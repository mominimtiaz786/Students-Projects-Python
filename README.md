There are several Python projects that can be completed within an hour and presented to 13-year-old students at a code school. Here are a few ideas:
<br>

Simple text-based game: You can create a simple text-based game, such as a choose-your-own-adventure story or a guessing game. This will allow students to learn about input/output, decision-making with if/else statements, and basic looping.
<br>

Basic calculator: A basic calculator is a simple project that can be completed in an hour and teaches students about basic math operations in Python. This could be as simple as creating a program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides two numbers.
<br>

Hangman game: Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that can be easily implemented in Python. This project will introduce students to working with strings and basic looping.
<br>

Random password generator: A random password generator is a useful tool that generates secure passwords. This project will teach students about generating random numbers and using them to create strings.
<br>

Image manipulation: You can create a simple program that manipulates images using the Python imaging library (PIL). For example, students could learn how to resize or rotate an image, or apply a filter to it.
